## URL Shortener

> Note: this is a hypothetical problem

### Let's create a [URL Shortener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening)!

After extensive research, AlphaSight's Product team figured out that we can greatly improve our relationship with our 
clients if the links we share with them are shorter because it would make it easier for them to share those links.
 
#### Main Goal: to shorten a URL to an AlphaSights equivalent

Here are the features we expect from our shortener [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)

1. given an url like `https://www.alphasights.com/careers/open-positions` we want to generate an shorter url like `http://go.as/a12b23c`  
2. if someone tries to access the generated url (`http://go.as/a12b23c`) they should be redirected to the original expanded url
3. if the same url is shortened twice, the same short url should be produced   
4. in the documentation, describe any limitation you can see and possible improvements

That's it! :star:

Follow the instructions in our [main README](../README.md) to send your challenge and good luck!

#### Bonus points

Although it's not required, completing bonus points will help us to better understand your level of knowledge across the multiple
disciplines. 

> If you decide to go for any of the bonus, you'll be evaluated under the same criteria of the main goal.   

Chose one or more of:

    • create an interface for the application that our admins can use to see the list of shortened URLs and their original links
    • save and show utilization stats 
    • enable to run our application in containers
    • create a Service exposing the functionalities of this app
