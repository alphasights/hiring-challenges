## URL Shortener

    Note: This is a hypothetical problem
    
#### Let's create a [URL Shortener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening)!

After extensive research, AlphaSight's Product team figured out that we can greatly improve our relationship with our 
clients if the links we share with them are shorter because it would make it easier for them to share those links.
 
#### Goal: to shorten any url to an AlphaSights equivalent

Here are the features we expect from our shortener [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)

1. given an url like `https://www.alphasights.com/careers/open-positions` we want to generate an shorter url like `http://go.as/a12b23c`  
2. if someone tries to access the generated url (`http://go.as/a12b23c`) they should be redirected to the original expanded url
3. if the same url is shortened twice, the same short url should be produced   
4. in the documentation, describe how many urls can your system handle, any limitation you can see and possible improvements

That's it! :star:
